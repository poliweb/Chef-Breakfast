### [Cooking instructions]{.title-font .text-2xl .font-medium .text-pink-500 .mb-3 .uppercase}

1 Prepare the ingredients.

2 Heat milk to 40Â°C. Combine half the flour, yeast, milk and 1 tsp in a blender bowl. Sahara. Beat until smooth, cover and leave in a warm place for 25-30 minutes. The dough will begin to rise, become frothy and increase in volume.

3 Separate the yolks from the whites. Cool the whites and beat with salt in a strong foam.

4 Add the remaining flour and sugar, yolks to the dough that has come up. Whisk thoroughly again. Fold in the beaten egg whites and fold gently with a spatula. Leave in a warm place and let the dough rise again.

5 Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in a little vegetable oil and add a piece of butter. Rotate the pan so that the oil completely coats the bottom.

6 Without stirring the dough, start baking pancakes. Pour a small ladle into the pan and rotate the pan so that the batter completely coats the bottom. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the edges of the pancake begin to brown. Pry off the edge with a spatula and flip over. Cook for 1-2 more minutes on the other side, then transfer to a serving platter. Keep pancakes warm until serving.

7 The dish is ready!
