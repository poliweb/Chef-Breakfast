Ukrainian borsch with beef and bacon is not just a hearty and thick soup with beets, as some people think. The taste of the dish should be multifaceted and, oddly enough, fresh.

The latter is achieved by a special technique that we use in this recipe. First, as is customary, beef broth is boiled, then vegetables are fried in lard for dressing. But in parallel with these classic steps, we do another non-standard one, namely, we bake beets in the oven. What for? In order to grate it later and put it in borscht at the last stage. And we will also add a maroon decoction of peel cut from raw beets. As a result, borsch will acquire both a bright color and a completely unique taste that will not allow you to limit yourself to just one bowl of soup.
