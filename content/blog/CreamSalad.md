### [Cooking instructions]{.title-font .text-2xl .font-medium .text-pink-500 .mb-3 .uppercase}

#### [Step 1]{.title-font .text-xl .font-medium .text-pink-500}

We clean the carrots and three on a coarse grater.

#### [Step 2]{.title-font .text-xl .font-medium .text-pink-500}

Pepper and tomatoes cut.

#### [Step 3]{.title-font .text-xl .font-medium .text-pink-500}

We cut the cheese into cubes.

#### [Step 4]{.title-font .text-xl .font-medium .text-pink-500}

Boil eggs, clean and cut into circles. Put everything in a salad bowl and mix. Salt - to taste, but be careful, because the cheese itself is quite salty. As a dressing, you can use mayonnaise or vegetable oil. Or make a gas station, as we wanted from the very beginning.

#### [Step 5]{.title-font .text-xl .font-medium .text-pink-500}

Dressing, which can also be used as a sauce for fish, meat and roasted vegetables, is very easy to make. Wash greens, peel garlic. You can take any greens you like. The amount of garlic - depending on your attitude to it. Finely chop the greens and garlic. Put everything in a beautiful bowl or gravy boat.

#### [Step 6]{.title-font .text-xl .font-medium .text-pink-500}

Add sour cream. Salt, pepper - to taste

#### [Step 7]{.title-font .text-xl .font-medium .text-pink-500}
