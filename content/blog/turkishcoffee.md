### [Instructions]{.title-font .text-2xl .font-medium .text-pink-500 .mb-3 .uppercase}

#### [Step 1]{.title-font .text-xl .font-medium .text-pink-500}

Place the sugar (if desired), water, and Turkish coffee in metal Turkish coffee pot (Cezve).

#### [Step 2]{.title-font .text-xl .font-medium .text-pink-500}

Using a small spoon, stir briefly until just combined and place pot on stovetop.

#### [Step 3]{.title-font .text-xl .font-medium .text-pink-500}

Slowly bring coffee mixture to a boil over medium heat. This will take 3-4 minutes, so keep a close watch.

#### [Step 4]{.title-font .text-xl .font-medium .text-pink-500}

As the coffee warms, you will see a dark foam building up. Closer to it coming to a boil, using a teaspoon, transfer some of the foam into each of your two Turkish coffee cups. Return coffee pot to stovetop.

#### [Step 5]{.title-font .text-xl .font-medium .text-pink-500}

As coffee comes to a boil, pour half of the coffee into the cups, over the foam.

#### [Step 6]{.title-font .text-xl .font-medium .text-pink-500}

Return coffee pot to stovetop and boil the remaining coffee for an additional 15-20 seconds and pour the rest in to the coffee cups to the rim.

#### [Step 7]{.title-font .text-xl .font-medium .text-pink-500}

Serve with water and Turkish delight.

### [Where can I find Turkish Coffee cups?]{.title-font .text-2xl .font-medium .text-pink-500 .mb-3 .uppercase}

If you ever visit Turkey and most other nearby countries, you can find a variety of options for Turkish coffee cups. However, if that is not possible you can easily find them online. Additionally, you can use espresso cups. They are a little larger but they would do the job.
